In the context of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), this concept is particularly important, as it determines the spatial extent of the features that a network can learn. While the term &quot;receptive field&quot; is often used in the context of CNNs, it is a fundamental concept in other machine learning (ML) architectures as well. This concept extends to transfomers, typically discussed in reference to masking within the attention mechanism, and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), where it is used to describe the temporal extent of the features that a network can learn. In this blog post, I will focus on the concept of receptive field in the context of CNNs, but think about how this concept might apply to other ML architectures as well.</p><h2 id="importance-of-receptive-field" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#importance-of-receptive-field" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Importance of Receptive Field</h2><p>Because receptive field defines the spatial extent of the features that a network can learn, it is a critical concept in the design of CNNs. The receptive determines the spatial resolution of the features that the network can learn. For example, a network designed with too small of a receptive field may miss global patterns that are crucial for the task at hand. On the other hand, a network designed with too large of a receptive field may be inefficient, as it will require more parameters to learn the same features. Too large of receptive field may also lead to spurious activations influencing the network&#39;s decision making, reducing performance.</p><h2 id="what-influences-receptive-field" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-influences-receptive-field" aria-hidden="true">#</a> What Influences Receptive Field?</h2><p>The receptive field of a network is influenced by the architecture of the network, including the number of layers, the size of the convolutional kernels, dilation rates of the kernel, and the stride of the convolutional layers. The receptive field of a network is also influenced by the pooling layers, which downsample the input space. However, it may not be immediately obvious as to why these components influence the receptive field. Kernel size, sure. A larger kernel takes in more information than a smaller kernel. But how do multiple convolutional layers influence the receptive field? What about pooling layers? What about a dilation rate? I never felt like this concept was explained particularly well. It&#39;s often taken as a given that readers will understand this concept when reading research papers. In the next section, I hope a concrete example will help you understand how these components influence the receptive field in a more visual way.</p><h2 id="visualizing-receptive-field" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#visualizing-receptive-field" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Visualizing Receptive Field</h2><p>In the context of CNNs, the receptive field of a network is often visualized as a grid of activations, where each activation represents the region of the input space that influences the corresponding activation in the next layer. In the following animation, we have a 1D time series (although this could be extended to an arbitrary number of dimensions). We use a filter of size 3 and a stride of 1. As you watch the annimation, the filter will be convolved over the input producing activations for the first layer. Then we follow a similar procedure for the second layer, convolving a filter of size 3 and a stride of 1 over the activations of the first layer.</p><img src="'+s+'" alt="Receptive Field Animation" style="width:100%;"><p>As you can see, stacking convolutional layers increases the receptive field, even if using the same kernel size. Many students find this concept counterintuitive. They often think receptive field is only influenced by the size of the kernel. However, using several successive convolutional layers allows the later layers to have a larger context. This stems from the way convolutional filters work. They are a pointwise multiplication of the input and filter, followed by the sum. The summation is what allows the receptive field to grow as activations are wieighted summations of surrounding points. In a similar way, pooling layers influence the receptive field. By downsampling, pooling layers allow kernels to cover a larger portion of the input space.</p><p>I hope this blog post has helped you understand the concept of receptive field in a more visual way.
