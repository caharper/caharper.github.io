This perspective fuels my interest in making complex concepts understandable and engaging, a principle I strive to apply whether in academic settings, blog posts, or discussions. Iâ€™m particularly fascinated by the potential of AI to offer personalized experiences rather than one-size-fits-all solutions. The success of platforms like ChatGPT underscores the shift towards more tailored, interaction-based exchanges, a trend I find both exciting and integral to the future of AI. Primarily, my academic research revolves around continous relaxations and reformulations to reduce the reliance on suboptimal hyperparameters. I am a strong advocate for open-source software and reproducible research, emphasizing the importance of presentation clarity and clean, effiecient code. I hope to contribute to a culture where complex ideas are demystified and where AI tools are developed with a focus on enhancing human creativity and problem-solving capabilities.")],-1)),_=i('<h2 id="education" tabindex="-1" data-v-102ec320><a class="header-anchor" href="#education" aria-hidden="true" data-v-102ec320>#</a> Education</h2><ul data-v-102ec320><li data-v-102ec320>(Pursuing) <strong data-v-102ec320>PhD in Computer Science</strong> - Southern Methodist University</li><li data-v-102ec320><strong data-v-102ec320>M.S. in Data Engineering</strong> - Southern Methodist University</li><li data-v-102ec320><strong data-v-102ec320>B.S. in Computer Engineering</strong> - Southern Methodist University</li><li data-v-102ec320><strong data-v-102ec320>B.S. in Mathematics</strong> - Southern Methodist University</li></ul><h2 id="development-experience" tabindex="-1" data-v-102ec320><a class="header-anchor" href="#development-experience" aria-hidden="true" data-v-102ec320>#</a> Development Experience</h2><p data-v-102ec320>During my time as a student, intern, and researcher, I have become proficient in a variety of programming languages and tools.
